/// GPU aggregation operation trait for two-phase aggregation.
///
/// This trait defines the contract for aggregation operations that can be executed
/// on the GPU using cuDF's group-by functionality. Aggregations follow a two-phase
/// pattern to support distributed and streaming execution:
///
/// 1. **Partial Phase**: Each input batch is aggregated independently, producing
///    partial results (e.g., partial sums, counts).
///
/// 2. **Final Phase**: Partial results are concatenated and re-aggregated to produce
///    the final output. The `merge` function combines the final aggregation results
///    into a single column.
///
/// # Example
///
/// For SUM aggregation:
/// - `partial_requests`: Returns a SUM aggregation request for the input column
/// - `final_requests`: Returns a SUM aggregation request for the partial sums
/// - `merge`: Returns the single summed column (identity operation for SUM)
pub trait CuDFAggregationOp: Debug + Send + Sync {
    /// Creates cuDF aggregation requests for the partial phase.
    ///
    /// Takes the input columns and returns aggregation requests to compute
    /// partial results for each input batch.
    fn partial_requests(&self, args: &[CuDFColumnView]) -> Result<Vec<AggregationRequest>>;

    /// Creates cuDF aggregation requests for the final phase.
    ///
    /// Takes the concatenated partial result columns and returns aggregation
    /// requests to compute the final aggregation.
    fn final_requests(&self, args: &[CuDFColumnView]) -> Result<Vec<AggregationRequest>>;

    /// Merges the final aggregation result columns into a single output column.
    ///
    /// For most aggregations this is an identity operation (returning the single
    /// result column), but some aggregations may need to combine multiple columns.
    fn merge(&self, args: &[CuDFColumnView]) -> Result<CuDFColumnView>;
